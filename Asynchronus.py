It still takes one execution step at a time. The difference is that the system may not wait for an execution step to be completed before moving on to the next one. This means that the program will move on to future execution steps even though a previous step hasn't yet finished and is still running elsewhere. This also means that the program knows what to do when a previous step does finish running.
